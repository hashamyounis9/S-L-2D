How to Play:
Welcome to the exciting world of Snake and Ladder! In this classic game, your goal is to reach or exceed position 100 on the game board before your opponent does. The game is played by rolling a dice to determine how many spaces your token will move forward. It's all about luck and strategy!
To roll the dice, simply click on the "Roll Dice" button and eagerly await the outcome. Once you've rolled the dice, your token will move forward by the number that appears on the dice. Keep a close eye on the position counter to see your progress.
But be wary of the treacherous snakes that inhabit the board! If your token lands on a snake's head, you'll slide down its body and find yourself at a lower position. It can be quite a setback, so watch out for those slithery creatures!
On the flip side, there are ladders scattered throughout the board that can be your saving grace. When you land on the base of a ladder, your token will ascend to the higher position at the top of the ladder. Use these ladders wisely to leapfrog your opponent and gain a significant advantage!
Remember, this game is played in turns with your opponent. Each player takes alternate rolls, eagerly anticipating their chance to move forward or strategize their next move. It's a thrilling race to the top, filled with surprises and twists at every step.
So, gather your friends or challenge the computer opponent, roll the dice, and embark on this exciting journey to conquer the board. May the luckiest player prevail and bask in the glory of victory! Enjoy the timeless fun of Snake and Ladder!
